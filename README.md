> A tale of a remote worker

## What is Long Distance Work?

This is a digital book, consisting a story about my journey into remote working and what I find helpful to keep my productivity throughout the years of my experience. This book may be helpful for a beginner who just get started into remote working to understand what to expect and prepare when you work remotely. 

## What do I Get From This Book? 

This book may answer some of these questions: 

- How to set expectation and get started with remote work?
- How to get the comfortable rythm when we work remotely?
- How to navigate timezone and cultural differences?
- Is it possible to work from everywhere?
- What does remote employment entail?

## Where Can I Read the Book? 

Head over to [this page](https://kelimuttu.github.io/long-distance-work/) read the digital book. 

## Are You Going to Publish a Full Version? 

If you read this digital book, you may notice that I mostly use direct storytelling and just scratch the surface on most topics. But it's all on purpose. Publishing a book is a long process. I publish this one as a digital book as a starting point to see if there's any interest for a more detailed version. I still have a full-time job, and writing is currently a side hobby for me. If you would love to see a more detailed or longer version of this book, please let me know by sending me your feedback! I also generally love to hear from my reader, so please [shoot me a message](https://kelimuttu.co/contact/)!

## Can I Order the Physical Book? 

I can't say for sure at the moment. But there's a possibility in the future to publish a more detailed version of this book through conventional publishing if there's any demand. If you work in the publishing industry, let's talk!
