# Remote onboarding

Despite the toolkits that I mentioned previously, each company may require a different set of tools. And chances are, you'll get to know more about it when you go through the onboarding process. 

Here are a few things to expect on remote onboarding process: 

- Device: Some companies may provide you or even require you to use the company's device for work-related activities. Make sure you understand their policy on device usage. 
- Software: Each company may utilize a different set of software programs and tech stack they may require. Make sure somebody is there to help you or point you out to the right documentation. 
- Buddy/onboarding mentor: You may need somebody to help you through the first week when you first get started. The person will be your main source of information, and it's usually somebody who you can ask lots of questions.
- Company culture onboarding: You may go through culture onboarding as well, where you'll be introduced to the company's mission and vision and get a rough idea of the company's working culture. 
- Team onboarding: Las but not least, you should expect to get to know your teammates as well. Normally, you will have to schedule one-on-one meetings with everybody on the team to get to know each other.
