# Remote toolkit

Tools for working remotely can be varied depending on the type of work that you're doing and means of communication that your team members are using. But the broad idea can be categorized like the following:

## Software

- Communication tool 
    - [Slack](https://slack.com/): Mostly for internal collaboration. Especially helpful for a large-scale company so we can make sure that conversations are separated in a dedicated space. 
    - [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/):  Convenient for a smaller scale company with less than 100 people.
    - [Matrix](https://matrix.org/): An open sourve alternative of Telegram.
    - [Zoom](https://zoom.us/): There are multiple other alternative that you can explore, but Zoom is probably the most familiar and convenient to use. 
- Scheduling and managing timezone
    - [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/): To synchronize your schedule.
    - [There](https://there.pm/): Great for keeping up with your teammates’ timezone.
    - [Calendly](https://calendly.com/): To set up a time to meet. Especially helpful if you're in an external-facing team like sales. 
    - [Doodle](https://doodle.com/): To set up time to meet. This is more like a voting tool. Especially helpful if we need to schedule a meeting with multiple. people across different time zones.
- Project management or productivity tool
    - [Trello](https://trello.com/): To track the progress of your projects. Can be powerful if you know how to customize it. 
    - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): Project management and personal notes. My personal favorite to track lots of things for personal and professional purpose. 
    - [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/): Keep to-do list or personal notes. Great option if you're using an Android device for you mobile. 
    - [Miro](https://miro.com/): An online collaboration platform. Can be used for team brainstorming, or a means to visualize your idea. 
    - [Panorama View](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/panorama-view/): One of my favorite add-ons so I can group tabs based on project/specific theme. 
    - Firefox Multi-Account container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/): Great for those who use multiple accounts for work/personal. 
- Data processing
    - [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel): Magic tool if you know the drill.
    - [Google Spreadsheet](docs.google.com/spreadsheets/): Similar to Excel but by Google.
    - [Airtable](https://airtable.com/): A prettier version of Excel/Spreadsheet. My personal favorite. 
- Security
    - [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) : So you don't have to memorize multiple passwords anymore. 
    - [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/): To monitor if you're impacted by a recent data breach. 
    - [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US): Online security is very important and it's always recommended to use multi-factor authentication. Google Authenticator is one of the most common options. 

## Hardware 

Sofware can't exist without hardware. And by hardware, I don't mean only electronics, but also other physical devices like desk and chair. But like I mentioned before, since I like to keep things basic when it comes to remote equipments, I won't talk about this in further detail. Let's see if other people will be intersted to provide recommendation on devices, but otherwise, you may look somewhere else to get device recommendation. 

And essentially, for me, the most important thing is not to have the most advanced tools, but to make the best of what we already have. Maybe sounds cliché but still relevant and rings true for me. (;
