# Incentives and Benefits

## Incentives 

And now, onto the money talk. Talking about salary is probably still considered taboo locally, but it shouldn't be that way. I think it's important to have a safe space for everybody to talk about money and especially how it relates to our work. 

Remote work makes it possible to hire talents without geographical limitations. However, that opportunity lead to another question. How does a remote company define salary for their remote employees?

Normally, a company will use the local rates for remuneration. But in my opinion, for a remote team, solely basing salary on the local rate is not fair, especially for those who live outside big cities. And more especially if their responsibility remains the same no matter where they are working from. 

Both merit and where the employee is based usually play a part to define remuneration for someone in a remote position. Usually, this will result in those people getting paid higher compared to the local standard, especially if they work for a foreign company. It’s definitely competitive compared to the local market rates but don't expect a Silicon Valley level. 

In [a Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2020/06/24/should-location-decide-salary-why-decentralized-pay-scales-are-the-future-of-wages/#277c5ba33403), Job van der Voort, Founder, and CEO of HR technology start-up Remote mentioned that: 

> “I live in Portugal where salaries are relatively low. What we’re seeing, however, is that more and more people – especially in high-demand professions like engineering, for example – are increasingly getting paid better rates comparable to large cities in Europe and even in the US.”

Furthermore, the article mentioned that “Recruiting from ‘cheap’ destinations has always been a false economy, so the issue of whether to pay local or global rates is really set to rise up recruiters’ agendas in the near future.”

And I personally believe that recruiting more remote workers to save money is the wrong strategy. One is because having a remote team doesn’t necessarily mean that a company can save money on office rent. Because, on the other hand, this remote team will most likely need a budget for an in-person team meeting in the future. And two is because an outlier remote team member who lives far away from the rest of the team will need to suffer more in order to collaborate. If done well, recruiting remote workers from a less expensive city is not a good reason for them to get paid less. And if it's for cheap labor, the manufacturing industry has given an example of the problem that they create by delegating their work to a cheaper country. 

But of course, there are also some companies that use the same rates (not dependent on location) for all of their employees. So, when you negotiate salary for a remote position, keep in mind to ask what kind of approach the company uses for their remote employees. “We don't value people based on salary” is a corporate talk that you don't have to take at face value. It's true that salary is not your self-worth, but it's equally important for the company to compensate people fairly. 

Depending on your legal arrangement, it's also important to factor in taxes. You have to understand the tax rate for your country and whether or not, the company will take care of your taxes. If they don't, you'll have to take care of it individually. Though you can also hire an accountant to help, which in that case, you may want to negotiate with your company for the additional cost. 

In a country with a progressive income tax rate like Indonesia, it's also important to note that your tax will be higher as you get more. The inflation rate is also another important metric to pay attention to when you negotiate salary. The impact can be subtle, but the effect will cost you in the long run.  

## Salary Calculator

It's not uncommon to see a company being open about its pay range nowadays. [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/) and [Buffer](https://buffer.com/salary/) are probably among the first who promote open salaries and build salary calculator. Apart from that, there are tons of other sources to research on pay range nowadays. [Glassdor](https://www.glassdoor.com/), for example, may provide you with information about the salary range for a specific role in a company.

There are probably multiple open salary repositories or surveys based on the industry and region like [this one](https://www.community.club/salaries) for those in the community role or [this one](https://twitter.com/petrabarus/status/1228607065481809921?s=09) for Indonesian working in the IT industry. They may give you a glimpse of an idea of the local rates. In addition to that, talking to friends or folks in the industry who are willing to be open about this kind of thing can also open your perspective when negotiating salary. 

## Benefits  

In terms of benefits, it mostly varies across companies and highly depends on your legal arrangement. A few companies might provide you with a reimbursable budget that you can use to buy home office equipment and furniture or pay for the internet or coworking subscription. Others might go for a no-string attached type of relationship, where they will only compensate based on how much time you actually spent working. In that scenario, the employee may have to submit timesheet approval periodically.

## The Myth of Travel as a Benefit 

I used to see travel as a benefit when it comes to working. But I no longer think that way today. First, travel is an overhead. It takes time to prepare, especially for international travel. It might be exciting at the beginning, but give it a few years, and you'll finally realize that you spend a lot of your personal time preparing and constantly on the road for those business trips you've taken!

This is especially true for me as a citizen with a not-so-powerful passport. I have to spend a lot of time preparing for visa applications and other bureaucracy. Not to mention the amount of time I spent on the road, which I can actually spend on other personal activities. There are also other side effects like jet lag and a mess-up sleeping schedule that will take time to remedy. 

France recognizes this by requiring companies to compensate their employee if they're asked to travel during non-business days. At least that's what I heard in the past, even though I can't find the reference for this policy. Even further, they ban employers to contact their employees during weekends[³](#footnotes). 

But of course, this is just my personal view. I still believe if we're doing it in a healthy amount, travel can still be exciting and provide you with many benefits. The company that I work for used to organize an in-person all-hands twice a year before the pandemic. And many of us will bring our families to the event and sometimes stay longer afterward. So yes, travel can be considered a benefit if we're doing it right and in a healthy amount. 

## Remote Worker Union

As of today, I have never been aware of a remote worker union. But I wouldn't be surprised (and I'm actually excited about the potential) if I see it in the coming years. As remote working becomes more mainstream, unionize can help to consolidate power.

> "Evidence shows that unions can help raise wages, increase job satisfaction, and reduce income inequality, among other improvements." - Heidi Shierholz (president of the progressive-leaning Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist at the Department of Labor)[⁴](#footnotes)

## What You Can Offer in Return

So far, I only speak about the employees' perspective when it comes to incentives and benefits. But as I mentioned. A relationship should be reciprocal. So, in addition to our personal benefits, we should also be clear about what we can give in return. The key is to know what you can offer in return. You should know where you stand in terms of things like your skill set, years of experience, an education level (though this gets less relevant nowadays), and what you achieved in your previous experience. If you're currently looking into pivoting to another venture that make it possible to do remotely, you may look into area like software engineering, data science, user experience, UI design, user research, or marketing. But I believe there are more areas/work that you can do remotely nowadays especially since the pandemic has kind of forced everybody to do it. When you're clear about what you can offer on the table, just then you'll have the bargaining power to negotiate what you think is fair for you.
