# Get out and socialize 

Even if you don't plan to explore a new place, getting out and socializing is still important for you. Whether you work from home or from the road, it’s still necessary to participate in the communal activity once in a while (I’d have to repeat this to emphasize the importance). And it’s actually good for your well-being. [An article from Psychology Today](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316) cited that “strong social connection leads to a 50% increased chance of longevity.”

It’s so easy for remote workers to isolate themselves from society without realizing it because we don’t have to go out every day. The first time I arrived in Bali, I know that I’d have to find a way to force myself to go out. That’s why one of the first things that I do when I moved is to subscribe to a coworking space. That's how I forced myself to commit.

In the end, it turned out that I enjoyed it a lot. I was excited about the idea that I have a fixed destination that I can go to regularly without an obligation to do so. And it’s liberating not to worry about internet connection since it’s being guaranteed by the coworking space. In other words, it frees our minds from thinking about those basic details and lets us focus on the actual work. 

In the [State of Remote Work 2019](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019) by the Buffer team, coworking accounts for 8% as a primary location for work, while coffee shops or cafés account for 4%. For me, the data makes sense because coworking has the system that most coffee shops couldn’t offer, such as: 

- It’s like an office but with more flexibility

Let me tell you this. If you’re struggling to transition as a remote worker because you missed the external accountability that you used to get from the office, then working from a coworking space would be perfect for you. It allows you to build a structure as if you work in the office, but with more flexibility. Your fellow member in a coworking space can give you similar peer pressure just by sitting by your side even though they have nothing to do with your work. It might also help if you struggle with procrastination when you work from home. 

- Learn new things in between

Most of the coworking spaces offer workshops or talks that you can join. Some of them even allow you to give a talk if you have an interesting topic. In fact, you don’t even have to attend those events to learn new things. Just by talking to the other member, you’ll likely learn one or two things new, since coworking space members are likely to come from diverse backgrounds. 

- Meet like-minded people

If you're just settling in a new city, a coworking space is a place where you can meet like-minded people who share the same values, especially in remote work. Who knows if they can turn into a friend, mentor, or even a business partner? But it's important to be genuine in building a new connection. You don't need to impress people to make them like you. And you don't need to tolerate shitty behavior just because you're dealing with a powerful person. An ideal relationship should be reciprocal.

- Give a sense of community

Last but not least, it also gives you a sense of community. Especially if you missed having coworkers like you used to have in an office. An article from [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/05/why-people-thrive-in-coworking-spaces) mentioned that “connection with others is a big reason why people pay to work in a communal space.”

However, of course, coworking space is not the only solution. You can also work from a shared office with your fellow remote workers. Or if you prefer to work from home most of the time, you can try to join local meetups related to your interest. The main idea is to get you out of your cave and socialize because as much as you like the internet, humans are still social animals.
