# Acknowledgements

I am deeply thankful to so many folks who involve, whether directly or indirectly, in the process of writing this book. My favorite manager ever, Konstantina Papadea. I'm forever grateful for all the wisdom and trust that you give to me all this time. My early readers: Kak Tere, mbak Ocha and mas Asep, Febri, Jimmy, and some others that I can't possibly list all here. Kak Fikri Rasyid for the interview session in the early days. Komunitas Kami Kerja Remote, especially those who helped me with the survey. Komunitas Semeton Elit Global for the moral support. 

And of course, my family. Thank you for letting me be myself (however quirky I can be) and pursue whatever I find interesting, even if it's not always easy to understand. Last but definitely not least, for my love, Daniel, for letting me indulge in my creative pursuit and for supporting me by being trusting and understanding.
