# About the author

![logo](../_media/author.svg ':size=20%')

Rizki Kelimutu is an indie author and remote worker. She has been working remotely since 2016 and enjoying every bit of it. This book is a means of sharing her experience. She believes in a world where people have more freedom to shape their life the way they want. Remote work makes it possible for moms to work from home, for marginalized people to achieve financial stability, or for people to choose to get out of big and overcrowded cities, and many other opportunities that remote work enables. And those are the main reason she's excited about remote working.
