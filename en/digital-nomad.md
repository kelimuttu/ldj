# The case of a digital nomad

Now, onto the glitter and rainbows talk! 

Digital nomad actually sounds more like a buzzword to me nowadays. I feel like it's just a term to convince people to spend their money on unnecessary travel and indulge in luxurious lifestyle that they may not be able to afford. 

But, I get it. Not everyone is after consumerism like what the advertisements trying to convince us. Some people may actually seek real adventure and the experience rather than trying to impress people with their lifestyle.

I may sound cynical towards the idea of digital nomad at this point. But don't worry. I  actually still believe that travel can be rewarding and bring lots of benefits. I just don't fancy the idea of labeling someone's activity into a buzzword that, in the end, promotes consumerism.

But, conversation about terms aside, now you may question what's so wrong with traveling around while working? 

Well, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, working while travelling is stressful. So, make sure that you're aware of the consequences before you commit yourself. One thing that I would recommend if you're highly curious on this idea is to travel locally. Especially if you don't have lots of experience with traveling. 

Instead of going abroad altogether, maybe try travel to a nearby city for a week and see how it feels like. Otherwise, Bali is a convenient fallback if you're lacking of ideas. 

## Working From Bali

If you've been thinking about this idea, you may wonder about a few things like how much it's actually cost, what should you expect, and things like that. 

If you're curious and you have the budget, I would say that by all means, do that and don't sweat too much about the details. 

Living cost is pretty much varied depending on your lifestyle, for sure. But my suggestion for folks who wanted to try this for the first time, is don't feel pressured to change your lifestyle too quickly. If you're currently live in a shared house or kost-kostan, don't feel pressured to stay in a villa. Especially if you're planning to sustain your lifestyle. It's easy for us to feel like we're preparing for a holiday since we're going into an exotic destination. But I'd say, if you're planning to stay for a month or more, you should condition yourself not to think that it's a holiday. There are plenty of resources to look for a place to stay, one of my favorites is the [@rumahkostbali](https://instagram.com/rumahkostbali) instagram account. If you're looking to stay from a resort, hotel, or villa for a weekend getaway, my go to source is [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/). 

That also applies to how you eat. If you don't typically go to cafe more than once a week, don't expect to try all the bistros and restaurants on your to do list in the first week of your stay. Take it easy, you'll have plenty of time to try them.

Also, try to build connection while you're there so you'll feel less alone in a new place. Join a coworking space, participate in a local community event, contact your acquaintance that you may already know, are some of the activities you can try to get to know new people while you're there. 

## Travel abroad 

Now, if you're in a place where you already confident that you can navigate the hurdle of working while traveling, you may now consider the idea to travel abroad. 

This concept is far easier to do for western folks whose salaries are so much higher than locals . Living abroad in Bali or Chiang Mai for lots of westerns is considered cheaper than living in their own country. So the option is totally makes sense to them. 

But on the contrary for us, as a citizen of a third-world-country, living abroad means that it'll be far more expensive than living in our own country. But this doesn't mean that we can't do it at all. It's still possible, we just have a more limited options. If you're highly curious, it's still possible to travel to nearby countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and live there for a few weeks/months. With that, we don't have to deal with visa madness since it's faily easier to get visa there as an Indonesian. 

## Relocate to another country

Another thing that you may wonder next is probably the possibility to recolate to another country. Becoming an expact is no longer an exclusive thing in today's society, where the line between cultural boundaries are getting blurry. 

There are plenty countries that offer digital nomad visa. A few that I know of that you may consider are: 

- [Portugal](https://imigrante.sef.pt/en/)

Portugal is a trendy destination in the digital nomad community nowadays. The requirements are not too complicated and fairly easy. Seasons in Portugal is also not too harsh compared to other European country, so it'll make it easier for us to adapt as an Indonesian. I would recommend to do an extensive research to look deeper and learn more about the full requirements if you're interested in this oppportunity. 

- [Estonia](https://www.e-resident.gov.ee/nomadvisa/) 

Estonia is a leading country when it comes to digital transformation. It's totally one of the most lucrative options out there if you're considering to move abroad as a digital nomad. If your monthly earning surpass the threshold of â‚¬3504 (before tax), then you're already eligible to apply.
