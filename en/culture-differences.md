# Timezone and Cultural Differences

It can be hard to navigate yourself in a new remote environment, let alone when you work in a multi-cultural and globally spread out team.

## Timezone

Timezone is going to be the number one challenge to think about. It's important to align with your employer, and how much of an overlap time you'll have to allocate to facilitate team communication. If you're dealing with a 6-7 hours difference, you can still pretty much have 4-5 hours of overlap time during your normal office hours.  

However, if you're dealing with a 10 or more hours difference, then you don't have a choice but to sacrifice between your evening /early morning. And of course, we can apply this arrangement both ways. 

It's important to align expectations with your manager to find your balance or equilibrium point. When they hire a remote team, they should expect to compromise and respect boundaries. And timezone expectation is one of the things you should get straight upfront.

## Culture

> “Every day, as I see how my new counterparts work in Spain, France, and Italy, I am asking myself if it is possible that what is obvious common sense to me may not be common sense in those environments.” ― Erin Meyer, The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business 

When you work in a multicultural team, you may find yourself puzzled by the different kinds of working or communication styles. Easy example, what you find funny might not be the same as other people from different cultural backgrounds. 

In this situation, we don't have other choices but to try to understand the differences. Here are a few things that I find helpful to navigate cultural differences in a work setting: 

- Understand high context vs low context

Culture has a great influence on the way we communicate. Low context countries like the US or Australia rely on communication at face value. "Say what you mean and mean what you say" is their mantra. Communication in a low-context way has to be direct and not expect them to read between the lines. 

On the other hand, people from low context countries like most Asian counties are considered to be high context. Meaning that they rely on collective awareness and implicit cues rather than direct communication. In a mixed setting, it's mostly better to default to the low context strategy by communicating in a direct way. This can be done by stating your main idea and making your point clear. Also, by the end of the conversation, it's always helpful to recap what has been decided and what should happen next.

- Understand their working style

Working for a US company for the past few years, I realized that there's a tendency for people to expect that they should be able to sell themselves. Of course, not in a literal way. But I find that most people that I worked with are not shy about sharing their work and the impact of the project that they handle. And that was a new thing for me. I used to think that as long as there's no complaint about my work, then I'm all set. And this new perspective is actually a good thing because with that, I am now forced to think about my work and how it relates to the company's goal. And knowing how my work can influence and contribute to that goal, is an empowering feeling. 

- Reach out to your people team for the Diversity & Inclusion program. 

I understand that we generally feel safer and more belong when surrounded by people with similar traits, interests, or cultural backgrounds. If your company has a Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) department, don't hesitate to reach out to them for an opportunity to get involved in a D&I program. It may enrich your experience, and I find it fun and empowering to be able to connect with people who may have similar cultures. 

I highly recommend reading The Culture Map book by Erin Meyer to learn deeper about how to navigate different cultures in a business setting. This book is especially important for everyone whose work entails communicating, managing, and influencing people from different cultural backgrounds.
