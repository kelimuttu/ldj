# A Tale of a Commuter

I bought the shoe for my thesis defense. It was a black flat shoe with a cute bow tie ornament. An ordinary one, but I use it quite frequently since it's very comfortable for me. And I didn't have a lot of shoes anyway.

But fast-forward perhaps 10 months after that, I have to give it up once I lost the bow tie in a commuter line. I was just graduated at that time and was in Jakarta for a job interview. For Jakarta's frequent commuter, maybe it's not a tragic story. We even heard [a story](https://www.liputan6.com/citizen6/read/3676924/ganasnya-gerbong-krl-wanita-sampai-ada-drama-hilang-sepatu-bak-cinderella) from a woman who found her shoe that she lost in a commuter line after she announced it on Twitter (the magic of the internet!). But hey, I was just an innocent fresh graduate from a rural area who have no idea if we have to squeeze ourselves in a 9 am commuter line because every carriage is such a can full of sardines. I barely know the route to get to the interview venue, let alone if I should just wear a flip-flop instead of a flat shoe.

Thankfully, the interview went fine and I got a callback. However, my broken black shoe gave birth to a new realization in myself. I know that I don't want to go through that experience in my everyday life. You know that quote that says: “If you don’t like where you are, move. You are not a tree”? Well, I believe it wholeheartedly. I know that I would hate myself for succumbing to a situation when I actually have another option.

Thanks to that missing bow tie, I get to experience myself as a big-city commuter, at least for once.
