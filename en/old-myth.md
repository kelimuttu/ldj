# Old Myths

I think about that stupid boss until I experienced my first remote job. I got the job coincidentally after a startup that I’ve worked for, for 10 months got shut down. I was excited and eager to try something new. But on the other hand, I was still shocked by the closure of the startup. It was my first full-time job (and I was an innocent fresh grad, remember?) so I was quite depressed for having to face the hard truth. That moment, I understand what people mean by Jakarta is ruthless.

I have a high hope that this remote job would do me a favor to cheer me up. After all, the flexible lifestyle that I imagined will now be possible, right? Working from my bed in a pajama or maybe from a coffee shop when I feel like it. It must be nice!

Except that it was not that easy. Transitioning to work remotely, especially when we used to work from an office is difficult. It’s hard not to think about the glamorous things that we can do as a remote worker, so we usually have a high expectation. However, we often forget the most important part. We also have to find a way to stay productive.

In my case, at first, I didn’t want to work from a cafe or coffee shop, because I was thinking that it was a waste of money. Why should we pay for a seat and wifi (I believed drink or food was just a formality in this case), when we used to have both for free by working in an office? I couldn’t justify it so I never tried to work from a cafe or coffee shop for the first 5 months since I work remotely.

Instead, I worked mostly from my bedroom which then hurt my spine because I didn’t even have a desk at that time. It was frustrating. I thought those remote myths are total scam! I didn’t feel glamorous at all.

Even worse, because most of my colleagues were in Europe at that time, I forced myself to follow their work schedule. I stayed up until late at night and sleep in the morning. It was a nightmare! 

Luckily, my awesome former manager gave me a few recommendations. When I told her in our one on one, how overwhelmed I was with my life at that time, she said that working remotely can lead you to 2 things. Either you’re being under worked, or being over worked. It was clear what happened to me back then.
