# Break free from the 9 to 5

Breaking free from 9 to 5 doesn’t mean instant freedom. In fact, it leads us to another question. How do we manage our schedule now that no one supervises us?

For me, the perfect analogy for this is like a high school and a university student. In high school, we don’t have to think about our schedule because it’s all have been defined by the school. On the contrary, as a university student, we have to think about what we want to achieve throughout the semester and build our own schedule based on that. As a university student, people expect us to be independent enough to manage our own schedule, and that’s exactly the same trait that people expect from a remote worker. 

Before the pandemic, I heard a lot of stories from local companies who tried to allow their employees to work remotely for once in a while, but still expect them to be online all the time during the office hours just like how they work from an office. I thought there’s a misalignment on how the employer perceives remote working versus how the employee actually expects.

From the employee’s point of view, I know that personal life gets in the way sometimes. And when they asked permission to work remotely, they immediately think that they could attend to their own business. However, being away from the office doesn’t mean that you can do your personal business simultaneously with your office work because no one supervises you. You still have to ask permission and an advance notice if we have something else to do during our usual office hours. 

The same goes for the employer. Not being responsive for a few minutes doesn’t mean that your employee is not productive. There’s nothing more annoying than getting pinged from coworkers when we want to focus on an important task. When we work together in the same room, you can notice if your coworker is doing serious work. However, when we work miles away from our team, we have no way to know if our coworker is seriously focusing on something or just slacking off. 

`“Tree time” is what we call our interrupted work time. - Belle Beth Cooper`

Belle Beth Cooper, founder of Hello Code call it a “tree time” in the book called The Ultimate Guide to Remote Work by Wade Foster and the Zapier Team. It’s a code that she shared with her co-founder whenever she wanted to have uninterrupted time to focus on something.

There’s no way we can do remote work without trust. And this is fundamental. If you keep on checking your teammates to see if they’re working, you just set yourself (and your teammates) for frustration.

However, that doesn’t mean that we can work whenever we like. Company and the employee should set their expectation upfront, whether they have a requirement when it comes to office hours, or about how much overlap they may need to communicate as a team. Overlap time between teammates is important to allow group discussion and collaboration. There’s no negotiation here. And that’s how the calendar is a crucial app for many remote workers.

A colleague of mine once said that “If it’s not on the calendar, it does not exist.” And that’s true. Most of the time, the first app that I check before starting the day is the calendar. The calendar, I believe is the second most important apps that I need for work after the browser.

Remote working actually teaches us to learn to appreciate people’s time more. In an office, we can just shout to each other to have a meeting. However, in a remote environment, you should learn to be considerate of each other. Scheduling a meeting is asking for attention that we can use to work on something else, so make sure to only schedule a meeting if it's necessary.  

There are lots of things to cover when it comes to managing our time as a remote worker. We haven’t even touch anything around time zone up to this point and it’s such a painful obstacle especially if you’re not used to work in a global team. 

From my previous story, it’s clear that we shouldn’t push ourselves to align our availability with the other team member’s time zone. And once I acknowledge it, I found that it’s such a pleasure to be able to have a quiet morning to work on something that need intense focus and when no one can interrupt you. You see, although confusing, working across different time zones can turn as a benefit rather than an obstacle if we look from another point of view.
