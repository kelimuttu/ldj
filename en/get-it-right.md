# Getting It Right

After I talked to my manager, I know that I have to get my schedule right if I’d like to fix my life. So, I start by doing an experiment. I set strict office hours. I kept myself focus on work during my office hour and I don’t touch anything outside of it.

However, that too didn’t work well. I felt guilty for ignoring work requests outside the office hour. On the contrary, I also felt irresponsible to do even a small chore outside of work during my office hour. And after some time, I finally realize that I missed the perks of being a remote worker. Because if having a tight schedule is the secret of remote working, then what’s our difference compared to a 9 to 5 worker? 

In an article[²](#footnotes), Steph Smith, the Head of Publication at Toptal, said: “working remotely gives you the freedom to design your life, both inside and outside of work.” So, I decided to embrace the beauty of a remote job, which is autonomy. At one point, I like to take a long break during lunchtime to learn to cook. Most of the time, when I have many meetings in the evening, I’ll start to work after lunch and take a break for 2-3 hours in the afternoon. 

But it’s not always like that. I like to mold my schedule to align with my current priority. If I know that I’m working on something that requires focus, I’ll choose to work in the morning when most of the other team members are offline, so I can totally focus on my work. However, when there’s a personal thing that I need to tend to in the morning, I wouldn’t hesitate to set my work aside and start later during the day.

From my manager, I also learned that having a separate zone to work helps a lot in terms of building a boundary between my personal and professional life. The house is supposed to be a place for us to relax. But when we work, we are expected to bring our best, so we need a conducive environment to support our thinking process. When both are mixed, we are setting ourselves for failure.

So then, thereafter, I bought myself a nice office desk that I know would make me excited to work. Now, whenever I'm in front of that desk, my mind could easily switch to work mode. Or every so often, when I feel like slacking off, I would dress properly (putting on a shoe can help too) to trick my mind that I’m in a professional mode. 

Many people love to invest in home office set up to level up their productivity. But I personally like to stay basic so that I won't be dependent on that equipment when I travel. Normally, I use a desk and an office chair, a laptop, one external monitor, and a headset or external speaker and that's it.

Of course, I’m just sharing what works for me. The main idea of autonomy is the ability to build your own system. You need to figure out what works best for you. However, here are a few basic things that I believe to be the most important aspects to be excel at remote-working:

- Get a reliable connection

If we are to adapt [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) for a remote worker, this one will sit at the bottom level as the most basic need. Let’s not talk about productivity before you get this one straight. If you work from home, at least you should get a reliable fiber connection. If you are working from the road, having a portable MiFi will save you tons of unnecessary yelps about unreliable café's Wi-Fi.

- Build routine

Because I have most of my meetings during the night, I usually define my work schedule based on the meetings that I have for the day. I also try to schedule incoming meeting requests on the same days as my other regular meeting, so that I would have the chance to work at normal hours on the other days. Defining a routine like this is necessary to make sure that we also have time to meet expectations outside of work. 

- Set boundaries

Apart from setting a physical boundary by having a home office, a time boundary is also important. For me, I would avoid having a midnight meeting more than once a week. It's also important to communicate your boundary to the other team member (set office hours in your calendar app can also help) so they understand and can respect your limit. 

- Give others time to understand what you do

It might be difficult to explain your situation, but I found it easier when I let my family watch how I work. At first, they think that I was just fooling around with my laptop. But when my family starts to see how I participate in a meeting, they slowly understand that I’m doing actual work. It takes time, so try to cultivate empathy and patience if you want others to understand what you do. 

- Get in touch with the outside world once in a while

Working outside your house once in a while is also important to make sure you’re in touch with the outside world. Join a coworking space or work from a café with other remote workers in your area will be even better. But the main idea here is to reduce the feeling of isolation because remote working can be a very lonely thing to do. 

It took me almost a year to finally get used to and feel confident and comfortable in doing remote work. I’m sharing this to make you feel less alone navigating a new work environment, especially when you're just getting started on your own remote-working journey.
