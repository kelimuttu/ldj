# Not an Option

I used to think that I can’t have freedom of my time unless I am being a freelancer or an entrepreneur. At that time, I know I didn’t want to be both. I knew as a fresh grad, I didn’t have the confidence to be a freelancer or the perseverance to be an entrepreneur (it’s me, ok? You don’t have to be that way). And I do think that I’d love to work in an office. Meet a lot of people every day, maybe hear one or two gossip during lunch because I suck at that kind of thing. 

And I know it’s true for a lot of people. Because if not, job fairs wouldn’t be crowded. People can just start a company or pitch to a project owner on a freelancer platform. For ordinary people like me, I can only think of working for a company which means that I’d need to trade my time from 9 to 5 in an office. It just seemed logical. 

However, it never occurred to me that I have another option, which is to work remotely for a company. At first, the idea to have a career without having to go to an office every day is quite surreal. And it sounds stupid, to be honest, if we think from the boss’s point of view. Who wants to pay people to just work from home? How stupid that boss is!
