# Communication

After we get the basics right, let's talk about the next-level thing, which is communication. When it comes to remote working, being proactive is key. Your colleagues can’t see you. So there’s no chance they know your situation unless you communicate it. Sometimes, over-communicate is even better than assuming that people understand your message.

However, a ping can also mean distraction. So make sure you put some thoughts on whether a question requires immediate response or can be done asynchronously. In a book called Working Remotely by Rocket Matter team, they made a point about “recognizing that not every question needs an answer right now.”

In addition to that, it’s also important to recognize the type of audience for the information you'd like to share. You have to distinguish if a piece of information is important for everyone in the company, only your team, or maybe only your manager. Being intentional in that way will save other people’s time in this information-overload era.

## Personal Ecology Exercise 

Another important thing to note is that you need to clearly specify the best way to reach out to you. Especially if you work in a big company that has more than 100 people. Whether it’s an IM app or Slack, make sure that you lead people in the right direction. 

There was an exercise that I did with my team about defining personal ecology. The term “ecology” itself is a term that has been used by botanists zoologists in studying the relationship between plants and animals to their environment. The concept itself was introduced by HG Duncan in 1928, which is more like a process of how a person relates him/herself to the various groups of which s/he becomes a member. 

Through this exercise, we try to get to know each other’s boundaries and use that knowledge as a reference to work with the person. The following table is an example of how we could set a personal communication strategy: 

**Kiki**

| Type of request | Best way to reach out to me |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Casual request | Ping me on Slack or Telegram (I prefer Telegram) |
| Normal request | Email me | 
| Urgent request | Call me (mind you, I’m based on +62) | 

I find that this exercise was helpful to help us recognize each other's boundaries and preferences. In addition to communication preferences, we also use this exercise to learn about each other's travel preferences. This is especially helpful to recognize how much notice a person needs for a business trip request, how frequent s/he's most comfortable with when it comes to business travel, etc. 

## Written vs Verbal

Of course, being excellent in written communication is a fundamental requirement in a remote team, so make sure to work on your typos if you want to work remotely. But typos can also probably be tolerated if you can communicate context pretty well. Whenever we are to communicate something,  try to always include the background information to make sure that everyone understands the context.

That being said, verbal and visual communication is still important for a remote team. I always try to show up in a video conference with a camera turned on to make sure that I can connect and feel closer with my team. 

And speaking about meetings, I found that coming to a meeting a few minutes before it starts, can be a great chance to catch up with your colleagues in a more casual setup. It’s fascinating how you can learn more about your colleagues through a brief banter like that. That being said, it'll probably also depend on your company culture. If being late is a normal thing, you may not get the benefit of showing up early to a meeting. 

# English Proficiency

If you're working in a global team like me, chances are, English proficiency would be one of the requirements. My advice for a beginner would be, don't be shy! The more you speak, the more you'll get better. I used to write down and rehearse my talking points before joining a meeting to make sure that I feel confident to communicate them. On a bad day, I will also use convoluted words when I couldn't find the exact term that I look for. It is a normal thing if you're not a native English speaker. Phrases like “I lost my words”, “what's that thing in English?”, or “I lost my train of thoughts” are normal in a meeting, and you shouldn't feel ashamed of that.
