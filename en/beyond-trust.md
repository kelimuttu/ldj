# Beyond trust

`“A remote work environment should encourage performance-not presence,” says entrepreneur Neil Patel. - The Ultimate Guide to Remote Work.`

A lot of times when we talked about remote working, we associate it with trust. But I think trust is overrated. You need to have a concrete way to measure your work. This comes to how you can prove that you’ve done your job and your ability to measure your impact.

From my own experience, I love using the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) system. Basically, objective define where we want to go, and key results are the indicator of whether or not we achieve our objective. I’m not going to go deeper into the OKR system, because I know each company might have a different system of setting goals. 

The point is, even though having a specialized skill is required to do your job, you also need the ability to communicate and measure your work. It’s easy to be ignored in a remote team, especially because no one knows what you’re working on. So, having a way to measure the impact of your work is important. 

Giving regular updates on a weekly or monthly basis can be one thing to ensure that we communicate our work. My team has a weekly check-in where we can give updates about the projects that we are working on. Personally, I also like to keep daily tasks whether on a physical notebook or a digital app even though it's not mandatory. It’s a great way to keep the history of our progress so we know exactly where we stand. It’s also a great way to highlight a priority task to make sure that it’s not being forgotten. Documentation is another important piece apart from being able to measure the impact of your work. In fact, they're actually related. Documentation is a means of sharing. If you want to communicate your work, documentation is a must. 

Some companies also require their employees to keep a log of their working hours. During the pandemic, I also notice that lots of local companies require their employees to do selfie whenever they start or log out of the day. I personally don't believe that a selfie can prove anything. But I understand that it's totally depends on your company arrangement. 

To track my own productivity, I personally use a digital time-tracker app installed on my computer and phone to track my overall time spent on each application. It’s a much more valuable information and a great way for me to get a sense of how productive I am in each week.
