# Distraction and Boundaries

When I stay in my hometown, sometimes my mom would ask me to accompany her to the bank or shop for groceries. I would say yes sometimes when I know that most of my meetings are in the evening, so I can start working later. But it was a long journey before my mom could understand that I couldn’t go with her all the time because I have work to do.

Yes, escaping the office means that you’re free from office interruptions. Maybe you hate that coworker who likes to play music loudly in the office or those who like to gossip around when you’re trying to focus on your task. However, you'll be then confronted by another looming enemy, which is yourself. Family, friends, social media, and television, are just objects that you're going to blame if you can’t resist yourself. When you work from home, it’s all up to you to be indulged in distractions or focus on your work. 

But you don’t have to hate yourself for that. And I understand that not everything is under your control. But let’s admit that deep down, we all have a desire to indulge in distraction or tend to our thing when no one supervises us to work. It’s a natural and completely normal feeling that we should acknowledge in order to be able to control it. 

One way to manage those temptations is by setting boundaries. It’s kind of related to balance, although I don’t believe in perfect balance. So let’s focus on boundaries:

- Physical boundary

Although it’s possible to work from the kitchen, living room, or even your bathroom, having a dedicated space to work in your house is important because it could create physical separation from your personal and professional life. For most of us, a house is a place to unwind. It’s hard to concentrate on your work if you keep on thinking about laying on your sofa while watching Netflix. Having a proper office set up in your house is also important for your health. Your neck and spine will be thankful for that ergonomic office chair of yours.

- Time boundary

Although my working schedule is highly dependent on my meetings, I try to also have a limit. Letting other people know that you’re wrapping up for the day could help your coworkers to understand and respect your time. I also mentioned that I try not to have a midnight meeting more than once a week. Your limit might be different. It’s your job to figure out what works best for you. You don't have to define a fixed office schedule if it’s not your jam and your company allows you to do it. My former colleague used to wear his office tag/lanyard whenever he works from home to trick his mind that he needs to be professional whenever he wears the tag. It can also be used as a sign for other family members. That way, your family members can tell if you're still working by seeing your office tag. 

- Attention boundary

This is probably the hardest part of setting boundaries. Our mind is hard to control, so we have to train them not to think about work when we don’t have to. You’re lucky if your coworkers don’t bother you on the weekends (like my awesome team). However, of course, the world is not perfect. When you work in a global team, chances are, there’s always gonna be someone online on your company's Slack channel. It’s a long process before I can easily ignore those messages when it’s time for me to sleep. Keep in mind that work will never end even if you work 24/7.
