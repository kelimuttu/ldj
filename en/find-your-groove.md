# Find your groove

If there's one key takeaway that I'd like to share to you by writing this book, it's that remote work takes a lot of experiment and practive to find what works best for you. And that's the beauty of it. The essence of remote work for me is to give the freedom back to individuals. You can't read a remote work 101 guidelines and expect things to work out perfectly in the first week. You still have to do the work and find what works best for you. It may take months or even years to figure out. 

And for some of you, you may realize in the end that remote work is probably not for you. And that's okay too. Just because this new approach seems exciting, doesn't mean that everybody should be excited too. In the end, we should all embrace that people are different in our own way. And each of us should strive to create a healthy environment for everyone depending on their preferences.

## What's the end goal?

I don't actually believe that full remote is the future of work. Even until now, I still enjoy working from an office. When I get to travel to one of our offices for an in-person meeting, I like to extend my stay just to be able to enjoy working from the office longer. I still love the feeling of surrounded by people, and I love the possibility of a more direct human connection instead of mere virtual. 

While full-remote arrangement become more mainstream, I consider the hybird model to be the best arrangement that works for me. Hybrid model is where company allows employees the freedom to choose to work from home or the office. But the the goal remains the same. Whether it's full remote or the hybrid model, what we should strive for is to give the freedom back to individuals to choose what works best for them. That way, we can feel more human and less like a machine.
