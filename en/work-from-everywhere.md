# Work From Everywhere

I think there are 2 kinds of remote workers. One is those who use the location-independent benefit to work from home and stay close to their families, and the second is those who use that opportunity to travel. I would emphasize here that no one is better than the other. You decide what works for you. 

I’m quite fortunate to have tried both lifestyles. On the second year of remote working journey, I moved to Bali and stay from a few different areas within 6 months period. It was a fairly unique and memorable experience for me. It also opened my mind about what does work while traveling really means.

The ability to work while traveling seems like everybody’s dream right now. Working from a beach or a pool almost like a career-goal for a lot of millennials. Thanks to Instagram and a lot of Youtubers who romanticized the term “digital nomad”. 

Work while traveling is a lot of fun, indeed. For me, there’s something about being in a new environment that stimulates creativity. I feel like I got tons of ideas when I let my mind wander while looking out from the train’s window, or at the beach while enjoying its cool breeze.

Also, who doesn't love nature? Coconut trees and the sands, green paddies with the chirps of the birds. We love all that. Not to mention the new and interesting culture that we discover in a foreign land. It’s exciting and refreshing. 

However, I should be fair. There are tons of behind-the-scenes struggles that we should face to make it work. It doesn’t mean that it’s not worth pursuing this lifestyle, but I think we should stop the romanticization and start to talk blatantly about the real consequences that we have to anticipate.

- Travel is exhausting but you get to see the world and it’s beautiful

It’s my intention to lay out the ugly part before we talk about what you can get in return, which seems more obvious. Travel requires a lot of preparation. That might explain why travel agency is such a lucrative business. Also, the travel itself is actually exhausting. If you travel abroad, there’s nothing luxurious about curling yourself up in the air for more than 10 hours (maybe unless you can afford the first class). Not to mention the lengthy process of getting a visa for a third-world country’s citizens. We haven’t even mention jetlag and exhaustion from constant exposure of new environment. If you still have to work while you travel, at some point you may also have to deal with crappy internet access. My only suggestion is: don’t try to mix both. Focus on your work when you have to. And do whatever you want after you finished your work. 

- Travel is also expensive but it enriches your soul

Let’s be honest. Travel is not cheap, especially if you want to make yourself comfortable along the way. Sure, maybe it feels super cheap for the west folks who got Silicon Valley salary and work from exotic place somewhere in South East Asia. But we know, the world is not perfect. An article from [news.com.au](https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/money/the-big-problem-with-the-socalled-digital-nomad-life-in-bali/news-story/35098dfd84f03b8ab13a1bfc7096076f) said that “only one in six digital nomads earns $100,000 annually or more while one in three earns less than $15,000 per year.” Just because you're able to work remotely, doesn't mean that you can automatically afford nomadic lifestyle. 

- It’s also lonely, although you can build more meaningful connections along the way

One of my favorite writers, Colin Wright, mentioned this in his memoir, My Exile Lifestyle “The hardest part about traveling so far has been the loneliness.” And it’s just so true. I cried on the first night I came to Bali because it scared the hell out of me for being miles away from my family and friends. Keep in mind that I’ve been living apart from my family since high school, but I still feel that way. And that is the kind of story that you won’t read from Instagram caption. I would recommend more people to watch Into The Wild to know the real struggle of traveling, despite McCandless’s being an extreme case. But the idea is, the world is wild out there. You’ll never know what you’ll get yourself into. And being in a place where you know no one, multiplies your anxiety. But of course, you can turn that into an opportunity to get to know more people. My recommendation if you would love to build connection is to try to stay at least 3 months in one place before moving to the next one to give you time to build more meaningful connections.
