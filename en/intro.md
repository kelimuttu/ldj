`"It is about workplace flexibility. It's about giving our associates the opportunity to be who they are as an individual, whether that is a community member, a spouse or parent, or anything in between." — Amy Freshman, ADP`

Today’s weather was a bit gloomy. It was 01:00 PM and from my apartment’s window, I could see the sky was cloudy and started drizzling. I was thinking, this is undoubtedly the perfect weather to work from home. Although ironically, it also embodied the struggle that we need to face as a remote worker to stay productive when there’s a massive desire to just lay down in our bed, especially when no one is watching us.

Normally, around this hour, I work alone in the apartment that I occupy with 2 other roommates. But today, they have also been working from the apartment after the pandemic started looming in Jakarta. And certainly, this didn’t happen only to my friends. Millions of people out there were probably experiencing remote work for the first time due to the pandemic.

Entering the third year of the pandemic, I become more convinced that remote work is here to stay. I believe that there are numerous potentials for enabling remote work in more places. Specifically, I believe most people will be relieved when they’re given the opportunity to break free from a big city like Jakarta. Embracing remote work means that we also give people the freedom to live wherever they want. 

But of course, it’s not only for the employees. If we want to sustain the idea of remote work, the company, and the employee should align on their expectations to be able to reap the most benefits from this arrangement. One obvious benefit for the company is a bigger talent pool without geographical limitation. Another one is about productivity. [Research from Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236375/engaged-remote-workforce.aspx) in 2017 showed that those people who spent about three or four days working offsite are more engaged in their jobs than people who have to stay in the office all week. 

In this book, I will talk about my experience of working remotely for a company since 2016. I will debug some myths and talk about how to stay productive while working from home, or generally wherever you decide to work from. 

When I reflect on myself and realize that it’s working for me, I’m certain that there must be many people out there who can do it as well. But I understand that things can be a little confusing for those who just get started. Especially, since remote working is quite new for most people in my country, Indonesia. There was very little opportunity of remote vacancy when we talk about local companies. But thanks to the pandemic, I think we can expect more local companies that started to embraced remote working. 

I’ve been dreaming about a world where I don’t have to explain to people why I can work from my home without seeing a puzzled face. I’d like to see remote working as a mainstream way of doing a job, especially since the world is moving into that direction. [An article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samantharadocchia/2018/07/31/50-of-the-us-workforce-will-soon-be-remote-heres-how-founders-can-manage-flexible-working-styles/#5b27a20b5767) from Forbes even noted that 50% of the US workforce will soon be remote, which probably might’ve already happened due to the pandemic. 

I’m not an expert by all means in this area. But I hope, reading this book will make you feel less alone to navigate the madness of working remotely, especially if you're just getting started. It’s normal to expect a bumpy ride at the beginning, but I’ll say for sure that the journey will be worth it.

Lastly, I want to clarify that all the things that I wrote here are solely my views and don’t represent my employers.

## Want to contribute?

The idea of this book was born in 2019 after I just finished my first book. The majority of the content also written in that same year. Obviously, the pandemic gave me a momentum to publish the book. However, having to cope with all the pandemic madness, I started to lose the momentum and ended up procrastinate. 2022 give me a new hope, now that many countries have started to lift their pandemic restrictions. But instead of publish it the old-school way, I decided to publish it digitally and open source it!

So yeah, if you're passionate about remote working and you know how this book could be improved, don't hesitate to send a PR!

There are multiple reasons you should send a PR: 

- English is not my mother tongue. I'm pretty sure there are grammar mistakes and misspells all over the place. If you're a grammar nazi, please cmiiw!
- My original plan was to publish the book in Indonesian, but I find myself more inspired to write in English. If you're keen to help localize the content into Bahasa Indonesia, please send a PR or [contact me](https://kelimuttu.co/contact/) if you don't know how to do it.
