# How to Structure Your Work

Some of us may be familiar with the terms white-collar and blue-collar. Blue-collar workers refer to people who engage in hard manual labor, typically in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, or maintenance. On the other hand, white-collar workers refer to the knowledge workers, who typically work from a desk and require minimal physical labor.

In manufacturing, for example, the process is usually pretty rigid, so they're able to automize the process using machines. Look at any kind of factory. The manufacturing process is clearly defined, so blue-collar workers also tend to specialize in one particular task rather than having to solve a complex problem. In general, blue-collar jobs are more structured in terms of processes. But it also requires more physical labor, so it's difficult to introduce remote arrangements. 

To be able to work remotely, most of the time, a person would require a white-collar job. But on the contrary, white-collar jobs are usually lacking structure and require the person to be able to discover their own way to solve a complex problem. That is why we often have to experiment to find what works best for us. 

There are a few techniques that you may want to try and see if it works for you.

## Inbox Zero Method

If you're an organized type, keeping an inbox zero might free you from the fear of missing out. Inbox zero is a rigorous approach to email management with the aim of keeping the inbox empty or zero at all times. In 2020, Jason Fried launched a new email service called [Hey](https://www.hey.com/) which, I believe, has a similar spirit to the inbox zero technique. 

If you're using Google mail, you can also apply a similar technique used by Hey by following my tutorial [here](https://kelimuttu.co/hey/).

## Pomodoro Technique

[Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management technique by breaking time into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, followed by 5 minutes break. If you struggle with distractions in your home, I recommend giving this a try. There are already tons of apps or browser extensions you can use to accommodate this technique.
