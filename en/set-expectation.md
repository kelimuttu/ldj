# Set the right expectation

We all know, there are a lot of benefits of working remotely. However, there’s one thing that we need to pay attention to before we talk about technicality which is how to set the right expectation based on our circumstances. This relates to the type of company that we’re working for, our legal arrangement with the company, and our individual living situation as well. 

First of, let’s talk about the different types of remote company out there: 

- Remote-first company

A remote-first company is a company that treats working remotely as a default way of working. This means some of their employees might still working from the offices, although there’s very little difference in the arrangement compared to the remote employees. Typically, these companies' teams are spread globally, and they’re free to set their own schedule, means of communication, or shape their office hours however they see best.

- Full-remote company

Similar to the remote-first company, a full-remote company is a company that also treats working remotely as a default way, but for obvious reason. And that is because they don’t have employees who work in the office. Although this doesn’t mean that they don’t have an office. Some of them might have an office only as a formality, but all of their employees are basically free to work from wherever they are. 

- Remote as an exception (may be remote-friendly but not remote-first)

This is an arrangement for a company whose most employees are working from an office. But there are a few people or sometimes a team (mostly the product team) who work remotely for a number of reasons. In a lot of cases, an individual employee needs to make a case on why they need to work remotely.

- Distributed offices

These are companies that have teams working from 2 or more different offices. Their employees might not necessarily work remotely, but their team still need to collaborate between offices. 

This thing matters because there’s a big difference in these arrangements. Although similar, remote-first and full-remote companies might face different challenges. For example, a remote-first company might experience friction between employees who are working from the office, compared to a full-remote company where everyone works remotely. 

On the other hand, employees on both remote-first and full-remote companies might face the same challenge on the brutal time-zone differences due to the nature of their global team. Some companies let their employees work whenever they want, although some prefer to group their employees based on the regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Middle-East) so they could maximize their overlap time. These differences will hugely affect the way we set our schedule because overlap time in a remote team is very important. 

> Working remotely, if it is to be successful, usually requires some overlap with the hours your coworkers are putting in. - Remote, office not required

In the book Remote, office not required, the author who’s also the founder of 37Signal or known as Basecamp now, mentioned that they need at least 4 hours overlap-time to facilitate collaboration and give chance for the team to interact with one another. 

The other two company types are considered hybrids, which means that they’re not optimized for remote-workers. So in those cases, the remote workers will likely need to align themself with how the majority of the other employees work. They will need to synchronize their work schedule or maybe will need to visit the office once in a while. 

Apart from that, the legal arrangement is also another thing to think about. Here are a few types of remote workers that will influence the legal-arrangement: 

- Full-time employee

A full-time employee usually gets the most benefit when working for a company. They’re legally employed and receive the full benefit as in insurance, bonuses, or other things. Most of them don’t need to worry about the taxes as well since it’s usually done by the company. 

- A contractor

As a contractor, one can work as a full-time employee or a part-time. A company usually hires part-time when they’re working on a temporary project that needs to be done in a certain period of time. While a full-time contractor might be hired due to legal-limitation in their country or if there’s a head-count limitation on a team. Mostly, a contractor will likely need to sort their own taxes and don’t receive full benefits like a full-time employee. 

- A freelancer

A freelancer is a bit different from being a contractor. Although both are self-employed, a freelancer will usually work for several clients or various projects at the same time, while contractors usually work for one client for a certain period of time. So still, both a contractor and a freelancer will need to sort their own taxes. 

- Remote-business owner

Things will also be a lot different if you’re a remote-business owner. You might have team members you need to manage besides the products you’re building, the operation of the company, and a lot more things that you need to think about if you’re a remote business owner. This doesn’t mean that you can’t make it simple. Paul Jarvis, the author of Company of one, explains in his book how staying small is a smart solution for the sustainability of a business. 

Lastly, your living-arrangement will also matter. And this is something that I just realized during the pandemic. If you work remotely while living with a family plus kids, your challenge is gonna be different compared to those who are living alone. These are a few things to consider based on your living situation: 

- Are you living with your parent?

You will need to explain your situation to your parent and other siblings to mitigate they're being puzzled about why you’re in the house all day. This will especially problematic for the old-school parent who might think that their kid runs into illegal business since they could get money without working in an office.

- Or with a partner?

The boundary between your professional and personal life is very thin when you work remotely. You probably need to put some thinking around how would you manage your working schedule so you could still maintain the house and have a great relationship with your partner. 

- Do you have kids?

When kids get into the equation, things can get a bit more complicated. You will have to think about child care division between family members. You may also consider having a dedicated office space to work in the house to avoid their intervension. The hardest part would be to make them understand about what you're doing.

- Or living in a shared house?

Some shared rules might be beneficial for those who live in a shared house. Agree to compromise and define some lines so you can maintain a great environment for everyone. 

- Do you live on your own?

Great! You can live however you want and you don’t need to explain anything to anyone. But, you still need to define your work schedule or at least find the best arrangement that makes you feel most productive. Experiment and tweaking is the only answer and I will talk about it more in the next chapter.
