# Lone Worker

Because I consider myself as an introvert, it never occurred to me that I’ll miss having coworkers when I start to work remotely. But it turned out, isolation is one of the major issues that make me struggle in the first few months.

I remember I used to visit my ex-coworkers a lot in their new office during my first year of working remotely. I found it understandable as I used to work in a traditional office set-up. So I thought I was giving myself some time to adapt. However, that makes me feel more miserable because it leads me to think that I’m not a good remote worker and probably better off to work from an office like I used to be. So I stopped doing that. 

In the second year, I thought I need to try something else. So I decided to move from Jakarta to Bali where I think is more remote-friendly. I stayed in Canggu for the first month but then I moved around to Ubud and Denpasar to experience different areas. 

Since then, I believe that working from a coworking space is a great thing! For the first time since I worked remotely, I feel like being understood. Suddenly, I don’t need to explain to my surrounding why do I don’t have to go to the office everyday like most people. It’s the most liberating feeling ever!

And just like that, I evolved from someone who thought that working from a cafe is a waste of money, to someone who actually pay a monthly subscription to get a seat and wifi on a coworking space. Of course, it’s not only seat and the wifi (although a great internet connection is also an important factor), but what I realized is that coworking space provides a sense of community that we didn’t get when we work from home.

But, if there’s no coworking space in your area, here are a few other tricks to make you feel less isolated when you work from home:

- Work from the outside for once in a while

I remember reading a story of a person who slowly loses the ability to talk in Indonesian since they work remotely for an global company and speak English more frequently because of that. Dreaded by the story, I try to make an effort to at least work from the outside of the house once a week. It doesn’t have to be that way, of course. There’s no one-stop solution to maintain sanity as a remote worker. You should find your own rhythm and style. Maybe work from a cafe, or share an office space with other remote workers. 

- Get support from your family

At one point, I decided to move back to my hometown. And since then, I found that family support is enough for me to immune myself from isolation. If you have kids, playing with your kids can be a great reliever when you’re under pressure. Or maybe get a pet. I believe having a pet falls under the same category as having support from family. 

- Virtual networking

Donut-call is a set-up where 2 or 3 random people will be paired together to talk about whatever they like. If you're comapny use Slack, there's a bot that you can install to automate the process. I personally like to join donut call when I don't have a high workload to get to know other coworkers that I may don't have a chance to work directly together. There's also other alternative like [Lunchclub](https://lunchclub.com/) to help you build professional network with other like-minded people in your industry. If you're merely looking for an accountibility buddy, service like [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/) will probably a beeter suit for you. 

- Join a local remote-worker community

It was something new that I tried when I moved to Bali and it turned out to be super fun. Being surrounded by like-minded people who share the same struggle as a remote worker is liberating. If you can't find one in your area, I believe there are also online communities you can join. Otherwise, you can always start a new one!
