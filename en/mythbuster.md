# Mythbuster

Maybe just like everything in life, remote working is not all glam and glitter like we all fantasized. Some of you might understand that if you had a chance to work from home during the pandemic. During the first few months, I learned that although the benefits sound very attractive, they also come with a price. 

So let’s do mythbuster thing!

- Flexibility to work from everywhere

Yes, if we can manage ourselves well enough to work from everywhere. Especially if you plan to work while traveling. Travel is exhausting and requires a lot of preparation. Yes, we can do it all together. But if you don’t do it right, it can lead you to burn out and create more problem in your life. At least I heard a true story about a remote worker who ended up with a lot of credit card debt that he uses to fund his travel. 

- Less distraction

If you choose to work from home, there are actually more distractions if we put into account the other family members who might think that you’re not working and thus, will ask you to do some chores. Not to mention TV and social media. After all, no one is watching us to see if we’re really working or just scrolling social media's timeline.

- Freedom of your time

Not really. You still have to work for 8 hours if you work full time. Besides, it can lead you to overwork too if you can’t draw the limit. Also, if your team members are scattered across time zones, that’ll be another challenge to think about. Unless you have a freedom to choose your own work schedule (which in this case is more about flexibility), freedom of your time is a myth. 

- Avoid toxic friends

Maybe you fantasized that you don’t have to meet your annoying friends at the office if you can work remotely. It must be nice, right? Except that it means you’ll also lose the other good friends that you often go hang out with. Everything comes with a price, ok?


Do I sound like a party pooper? Don't sweat, though. Because of course on the flip side of it, we also gain other perks that make remote working worth doing. At least from my experience, here are some of the perks that we can get:

- No more commute

When I decided to write this book, I run a small survey to find out what other people think of remote working. It’s no surprise that this is one of the most mentioned benefits of remote working that I read from the survey. And it’s just so true. The ability to not commute to work every day is a valuable advantage. A study from Boston Consulting Group featuring Uber in 2017[¹](#footnotes) reveals that on average, Jakartans spent 31.680 minutes (that’s equal to 22 days) to commute on a four wheels vehicle every year. It’s more than how many paid time off you can take per year, isn't it?

- Location independent

Another greatest advantage is, of course, the freedom to live from wherever you want. This is especially beneficial for talents from a small city, so they don’t have to move to a big city just for work. As a result, you can stay closer with your loved ones or maybe go for an adventure to places you can only imagine before. 

- Set your own schedule

If you’re not a morning person and prefer to work at night, you can win a lot by working remotely. This is specifically true for a job that also gives you flexible schedule. The ability to manage your work-time, so you can focus on work when you’re at your best is truly satisfying.

- Pajamas all day long

After a few years of working remotely, I become aware that now I own more pajamas and t-shirts than blouses. Even in some meetings, I only cover my pajamas with a sweater so I don’t look too sloppy. Although, once in a while, I also like to dress up appropriately even though I only work from accross the room.

- Sing it all away

This feels especially true for people like me who likes to sing or listen to loud music while working. Being a remote worker means that I don’t need to worry to wear headphones while listening to music. Even better, I can sing it out loud whenever I like without having to worry if I disturb my fellow coworkers.
